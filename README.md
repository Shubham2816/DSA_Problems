Here’s a polished and structured **README.md** draft tailored for your repository:

---

# 🧠 DSA\_Problems

This repository is a collection of solutions and implementations for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It’s designed to help you practice, sharpen your coding skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

## 🏷️ Topics Covered

Organized into folders by DSA category, such as:

* **Arrays & Strings** (e.g. Move Zeroes, Maximum Sum Subarray, Rotate Array)
* **Hashmaps** (e.g. Palindrome Checks)
* **Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs** – TBD or in future updates
* …and more

Each folder contains Java (or other language) implementations of related problems.

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

To get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubham2816/DSA_Problems.git
cd DSA_Problems
# Navigate into a folder, e.g.
cd Arrays
# Compile & run a Java solution:
javac Solution.java
java Solution
```

## 💡 Problem List and Structure

Each subfolder typically contains:

* Problem name as `.java` file(s) (e.g. `MaximumSumSubarray.java`)
* Solutions implementing standard approaches
* In some cases, multiple methods in a single file (brute‑force and optimized)

A **README.md** at the root (this file) and optionally folder-level READMEs can explain the contents.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions welcome! To add solutions or improvements:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-idea`)
3. Add your solution(s) and tests
4. Commit changes and push (`git push`)
5. Open a Pull Request with a clear description

## 📖 About

This collection is a personal practice project showcasing implementations of core DSA problems in Java (or other languages as added). It helps strengthen problem-solving skills and support interview preparation ([github.com][1], [github.com][2]).

---

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

* Add more data structure categories (e.g. Trees, Graphs)
* Include readmes in subfolders summarizing problem coverage
* Add unit tests for each solution
* Possibly support multiple languages (Python, C++)

Feel free to tweak any sections or add more details (e.g. dependencies, input format). Let me know if you’d like help customizing further!
